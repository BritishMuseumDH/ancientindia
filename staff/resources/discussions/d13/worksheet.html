			<div class="subtitle">Discussion:</div>Discuss why writing is important, emphasizing that writing is a way to communicate 
			information over distance and time, and that writing is a way to record information about business, beliefs and ideas. 
			<i>Why is writing important? How is writing used?</i>
			<p>Ask pupils how they use writing in their daily lives, and to imagine what life would be like if they did not write things 
			down. <i>How could you communicate information if you did not have a writing system? </i></p>
			Discuss different types of information recording systems. Ask pupils to consider how information could be communicated if you 
			did not use a writing system. Explain that one of the first systems used by the ancient Egyptians was a picture- based system. 
			Discuss what the benefits and/or difficulties of a system like that might be. Compare and contrast a picture-based and a 
			writing system. <i>What kind of information could you convey using a picture-based system? What kind of information would it be 
			difficult to convey using a picture-based system?</i>
			<p>Ask pupils to consider other ways that information can be conveyed and 'recorded' such as through stories passed down 
			through generations. <i>How are the details of your own life preserved? How does writing something down change the accuracy 
			and longevity of the information you want to preserve?  What are the benefits and problems with communicating and keeping 
			track of important information through an oral tradition?</i></p>
			Wrap up the discussion by showing photographs of writing
