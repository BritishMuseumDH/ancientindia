			<div class="subtitle">Activity:</div> Ask children to investigate the Explore and Challenge sections of the Early Hinduism chapter. From the information included in these activities, ask them to choose one of the Hindu gods or incarnations of Vishnu whose story they would like to portray in textile form. (See Unit 5C of QCA scheme for preliminary work examining how stories are related in textiles). You may wish to limit their choices to those about which you have books, for example, Ganesh and Rama.
			<p>Once the children have selected their subject, ask them to use the website and books to find out the main events of the story.  They will then need to decide which events will be shown in their textile. If this is a small group project, they will need to decide who is working on which event. When the events are chosen, the children will draft a suitable image for each event in a story board format, thinking carefully about the available materials as they do so. They will also need to think about the ease of making their images using fabrics.</p>
			Discuss with the children how they are going to assemble the images using textiles, for example using appliqu&eacute; techniques, embroidery or fabric paints. They may also need to do some skills exercises to practise particular stitches, but can use glue as well. Ask the children to write a design specification which will show how they will make their textile story and lists the necessary materials.
			<p>The children can then gather the materials and make their textile story. The completed work could be used for a display linked to RE work on Hinduism. </p>
