			<div class="subtitle">Objectives:</div>To understand the size, scale and geography of India. To be able to measure distances on scaled maps, to understand how physical features are represented on maps. To learn about Buddhist and Hindu pilgrimage in India.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Materials:</div>Various maps of India showing different scales and features, physical, political, etc. Books, wide range of resources on Hinduism and Buddhism.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Class set-up:</div>Whole class discussion, groups or partner work.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Vocabulary:</div> Scale, transport, pilgrimage<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Activity:</div> If possible introduce the activity by discussing a large map of India. Ask the children how big they think India is in comparison to the UK, other places, their town, etc. Try to establish a sense of size and scale. Measure the distance between two selected places on the map and model converting centimetres into kilometres using the map for the children. They can try this themselves. Discuss ways and modes of transport, how long it would take to travel set distances, on foot, by horse, cart or today by train, plane, etc. The children can use the Geography section to find out about pilgrimages, and then the Challenge to try pilgrimage for themselves. 
			<p>The children can now plan their own journeys from place to place, calculating distance and journey time. They should aim to bear in mind the types of physical obstacles which may slow down their journey. </p>
			The children could write imaginary journals, based upon knowledge gleaned from the site and from ideas about what the journey will be like based upon ideas gained from the maps.<p></p>
