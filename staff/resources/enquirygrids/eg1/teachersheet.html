			<div class="subtitle">Individual project:</div>Introduce the activity by asking children to carefully read through the story section of the Buddha chapter. When they have read through it once, explain that they are going to be making notes on the main points of the story using an enquiry grid. Provide key vocabulary for the column 'Stage in Buddha's life' e.g. birth, marriage, early adulthood etc. Explain the type of information appropriate to the other columns and that there is enough space for ten sections of the story. Remind children about effective note-taking and identifying key information. Children gather information on the grid. They then use the enquiry grid to produce their own picture book relating the events of Buddha's life for a slightly younger audience.<p></p>			
			<div class="subtitle">Class project:</div>Introduce the activity by asking children to carefully read through the story section of the Buddha chapter. When they have read through it once, explain that they are going to be making notes on the main points of the story using an enquiry grid. Provide key vocabulary as above and explain the type of information needed. Children gather information on the grid. Children are then divided into groups of four. The teacher then gives each group one or two sections from the story for them to enact, using a narrator each time and referring to their enquiry grids to ensure the content is correct. When the groups are ready, they can each show their scenes consecutively to provide the narrative of the Buddha's life. It might be useful for the Buddha in each group to have a label or an item of clothing that signifies this character each time.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Extensions:</div>Ask pupils to carry out their own research into the beliefs and practices of Buddhists, which could be presented to the class orally or as a PowerPoint presentation, as a follow up to their work on Buddha.<p></p>
