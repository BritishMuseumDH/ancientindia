			<div class="subtitle">Extensions:</div>Ask pupils to find out what other animals existed in ancient India.

			<p><div class="subtitle">Teacher notes:</div>Many different types of animals lived in ancient India. Some were indigenous to the Indus valley and the surrounding areas.
			<p>Many animals had religious significance, or were associated with gods or deities. Thus, when animals appear in ancient Indian art, they are often symbolic of something as well as being representative of a particular type of animal.</p>
