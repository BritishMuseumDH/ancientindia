			<div class="subtitle">Individual project:</div>Have pupils spend some time looking at the Indus chapter on the site. The pupils should take extra notice of the Indus Story and the ideas on how historians and archaeologists know about the Indus Valley civilization.
			<p>If pupils are working on their own they should use the enquiry grid to gather evidence to write an account, draw an illustration, make a poster or diagram, etc of life in an Indus Valley settlement, detailing how we know that the statements they make are true.</p>
			<div class="subtitle">Class project:</div>The children could make a wall frieze showing the layout of an ancient Indian town or city, detailing significant buildings and areas. Each pair/group of children could detail a trade or activity that might have occurred in buildings around the town. The children could use drawings, photographs and writing to illustrate what they learnt about the people of the Indus Valley. There could be one group overlaying places where archaeological evidence was found and what evidence it provided for the children's work.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Extensions:</div>Pupils could try to compare life in the Indus settlements with places in other parts of the world at similar times. <i>What sort of climatic and environmental differences are there between the two places?</i><p></p>
