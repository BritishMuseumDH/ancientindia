Ask pupils to look at some of the artefacts from the Indus Valley civilization and try to find out what sort of tools and skills the craftsmen would need. After they have recorded their information on the enquiry grid, ask them to present what they learnt in the form of a poster detailing the different crafts or the processes of making one of the artefacts.<p></p>
			<div class="subtitle">Class project:</div>	Introduce the activity by defining what are trades and craftsmen. Show pupils photographs of objects from ancient India. Brainstorm children's ideas about the Indus Valley artefacts and what they were made from and how they were made.  Divide children into small groups, each given a different type of artefact. 
			<p>Discuss the people who are involved in crafts. Ask pupils to think about the training that they need, the materials that they work with, the tools they use and the quality of the work that they produce. Discuss what we can learn about craftsmen from the evidence that has survived.</p>
			<i>What kind of tools would they have used? What sort of materials have they used? 
			Would these skills have been difficult to learn? Were these craftsmen important people 
			to the community?</i>
			<P><I>What can we learn about ancient Indian trades and crafts from looking at their tools and the objects that they made?</i></p>
