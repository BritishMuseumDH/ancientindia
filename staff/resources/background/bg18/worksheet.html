<p>A major new development was the importing of raw materials from distant source areas to workshops in the larger towns and cities.  Whereas the initial processing of the raw material occurred at source areas, final processing was done in workshops located at the settlements where both quality and style of the manufactured objects could be controlled.</p>

<b>Beads</b>
<ul><li>Carnelian beads with white patterns on a red background (bleached or etched beads) were most highly valued
<li>Carnelian beads processed in Dholavira and Lothal may have been delivered to districts throughout the Indus Valley and exported to many parts of West Asia.
</ul>
<b>Craft specialisation</b><br>
Raw materials aquired from:<br>
<ul>
<li>Copper (Rajasthan)
<li>Gold (southern India and Persia)
<li>Silver and tib (Persia)
<li>Lead (Persia and Rajasthan)<br>
<b>Crafts</b>
<li>Beads
<li>Copper
<li>Pottery
<li>Dyers
</ul>
<b>Uniformity in craft production.</b><br>
With final processes being done in workshops located at the settlements, certain control measures and trading standards ensured consistent quality and style. These included:
<ul>
<li>Use of weights and measures
<li>Use of seals
</ul>
<p></p>
<b>Trade with Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia, use of monsoon winds.</b><br>
The monsoon winds controlled elements of the craft trade. Exchanges between India and the Red Sea occurred from November to April utilising the Northeast monsoon winds. However, trade between the Red Sea and India occurred between July and September utilising Southwest monsoons.
