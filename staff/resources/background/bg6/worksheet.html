 			<tr><td>The Indus is a very large, complex river in Pakistan. The source of the Indus river is Singikabab (5165 m altitude), near the Mansarover Lake in Tibet.  This lake is also the source for the other major tributary of the Indus, the River Sutlej.  It is 2900 km. long and flows through the Himalayas and the Punjab before entering Pakistan.  The Indus has five main tributaries, the Jhelum, the Sutlej, the Beas, the Ravi and the Chenab.  Besides its tributaries, the River Indus is fed by the water from the melted snow of the Himalayas.
			<P>The Indus is prone to flooding in the summer. This can be dangerous to human settlement. These floods are unpredictable as they do not strike everywhere at the same time or even the same year. The banks of the river are very unstable and during floods they can collapse leading to the destruction of settlements located on the banks. The silt left after the floods have receded is extraordinarily fertile.  The soft rich earth is used for agriculture with a high productivity yield. The river is navigable only in certain parts of its course and only during the low water period.</p>
