<p>			According to the Buddha, there were four sacred places for worshippers to visit.</p>

His birthplace at Lumbini.<br>
The place where he achieved supreme enlightenment at Bodh Gaya.<br>
The place where he delivered his first sermon, the deer park in Sarnath.<br>
The place where he achieved Nirvana, Kusinagara.<br>

<br>A Buddhist worshipper was expected to visit the four sites, in the above order, to chart the Buddha's life. These pilgrimages were an important act for a Buddhist, in order to achieve spiritual happiness, taking the pilgrim to heaven.

<p>Relics and pilgrimage monuments (stupas) constituted the material foci of this spiritual journey.</p>
