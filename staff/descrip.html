	<td><p>The site is divided into six 'chapters' which address themes or topics relevant to ancient India. The six 'chapters' 
	are presented on a menu page where the user can choose a chapter by clicking on the word or icon relating to that chapter.</P>
	<P>For each chapter there is a 'Doormat' page, which is an atmospheric introductory page to the chapter.  The Doormat page 
	will automatically switch to the 'Home Page' after a few seconds.  However, clicking on the picture will switch it immediately. 
	The 'Home Page' is an introductory page for the chapter.</P>
	 <P>Within each 'chapter' there are three sections: 'Story', 'Explore' and 'Challenge'.</P>
	 <ul>
		<LI><P>The 'Story' is a presentation of information in a narrative form.</P></li>
	 	<LI><P>The 'Explore' is a non-linear presentation of information. The pupil controls the order in which they access the information. 
		It is then the responsibility of the pupil (and/or the teacher) to make larger connections among ideas and information and place 
		the information in a context or framework.</P></li>
		<LI><P>The 'Challenge' is an activity that allows pupils to practise certain skills (historical, analytical, mathematical, observational) 
		within the context of a theme or topic relevant to ancient India. </P></li>
