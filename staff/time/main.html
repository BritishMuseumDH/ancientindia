	<td><p>The challenge asks the user to place four Ancient Indian artefacts in chronological order. To help complete the task they are assisted by four experts who may or may not be able to help date the artifact, depending on what type of object it is.  This challenge can be used to look at basic chronology and terms such as B.C. and A.D. On a more sophisticated level it asks the user to evaluate the different types of advice available to them, and assess which type of evidence is more useful to them.</p>
