<h3>Matsya</h3>
<p>
The first incarnation of Vishnu was a little fish called Matsya. Matsya was the colour of gold and had one horn.
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/matsya.jpg" width="300" height="143" alt="Matsya" border="0"></div>
<p>
Vishnu was sent to earth as Matsya to protect a sage named Vaivaswata from a flood. 
</p>
<p>
Matsya starts out as a small fish, but grows until he is forty million miles long at the coming of the flood. Matsya also tows Vaivaswata's boat by tying a rope to the boat and attaching it to his horn.
