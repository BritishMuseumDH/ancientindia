<h3>Buddha</h3>
<p>
The ninth incarnation of Vishnu was the Buddha. The Buddha was born a prince but gave up his princely life to pursue an understanding of suffering in the world.
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/buddha.jpg" width="167" height="300" alt="Buddha" border="0"></div>
<p>
Vishnu was sent to earth as the Buddha to restore the importance of belief and spiritual righteousness to a world which had lost faith. 
</p>
<p>
The Buddha was born Prince Siddhartha and lived the life of a prince until he was a young man. He was sheltered from the outside world and was unaware of suffering and pain in the world. 
</p>
<p>
One day Siddhartha left the palace grounds and went out into the city beyond. On the streets of the city he saw suffering for the first time. He decided to leave the palace and journey out into the world to gain some understanding of the nature of suffering.
</p>
<p>
Prince Siddhartha met many wise men on his journey, but none of them could give him the answers he was looking for. Finally, through <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/meditation.html','medit')">meditation</a>, Siddhartha was able to reach <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/enlightenment.html','enli')">Enlightenment</a>. Through his search he had gained an understanding of suffering in the world and taught others about how to live a good and spiritually full life.
</p>
<p>
The Buddha serves a special function in the Hindu religion. Although Hindus believe that the Buddha was one of the incarnations of Vishnu, his teachings were contrary to those of the Hindus. The Buddha was actually included as an incarnation of Vishnu to represent false teachings. The belief was that people would recognise the error of the Buddha's teachings and return to Hindu beliefs with a revived sense of <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/devotion.html','devo')">devotion</a> and <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/appreciation.html','appr')">appreciation</a> for the Hindu religion.
