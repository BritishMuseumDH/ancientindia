<p>
Once Prince Siddhartha had seen suffering in the world outside the palace walls, he vowed to leave the palace and seek a greater understanding of the world. 
</p>
<p>
Siddhartha left the palace in the middle of the night with his horse Kanthaka and his groom Chandaka. At the village gate, Siddhartha took off his princely robes and cut his hair. He sent his groom and horse back to the palace. Then he began his journey alone. 
</p>
<p>
This scene shows Siddhartha sitting on a throne saying goodbye to his horse and groom. Chandaka holds his <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/staff.html','staf')">staff</a> and kneels in front of Siddhartha. Kanthaka's head can be seen to the right of Siddhartha.
