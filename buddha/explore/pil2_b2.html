As Siddhartha was reaching <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/enlightenment.html','enli')">Enlightenment</a>, a demon-king called Mara sent an army to attack him. When the army reached Siddhartha, the demon-king challenged his generosity, goodness and <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/piety.html','piet')">piety</a>. 
</p>
Siddhartha called upon the Earth as a witness to his <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/v/virtue.html','virt')">virtues</a>. The Earth goddess acknowledged his virtues and the army of the demon-king fled when they realised Siddhartha's great power.
<p>
The demon-king then sent his three daughters to dance for Siddhartha. However, he would not be distracted and the women left him alone.

<p>
This scene shows the Buddha sitting on a throne. In front of him are small figures who may represent the soldiers from the demon-king's army. On either side of the throne stands a woman. The woman on the left holds her hands in a <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/g/gesture.html','gest')">gesture</a> of worship. The woman on the right looks as though she is dancing. She may represent one of the demon-king's daughters.
