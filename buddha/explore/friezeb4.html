<p>
Prince Siddhartha left the palace in the middle of the night to seek a greater understanding of the world. He took his horse Kanthaka and his groom Chandaka with him. 
</p>
At the city gate, Siddhartha took off his princely robes and cut his hair. He sent his groom and horse back to the palace. Then he began his journey alone. 
<p>
In this scene, Siddhartha sits upon a throne taking leave of his kneeling groom, Chandaka and his horse, Kanthaka. The other figures in the scene are probably worshippers.
