<p>
Queen Maya had a dream that a white elephant entered her right side. She told her husband of her dream and they consulted his court <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/sage.html','sage')">sage</a> to learn the meaning of the dream. They were told that they would have a child who would grow up to be either a great emperor or a great spiritual leader.

This scene shows the king seated on his throne with Queen Maya to his right. The king and queen are surrounded by several sages, <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/courtiers.html','cour')">courtiers</a> and attendants.
