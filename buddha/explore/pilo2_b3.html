After many years of teaching, the Buddha died at the age of 80. His body was <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/cremated.html','crem')">cremated</a> and his ashes were divided into eight parts. The ashes were then deposited in several special mound-shaped monuments called 'stupas'. Umbrellas were often mounted at the top of stupas as a sign of honour and respect.

<p>
When stupas appear in Buddhist art, they are either showing actual stupas, or they symbolize the Buddha's death.
