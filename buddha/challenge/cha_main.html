When the Buddha died, he had touched many people with his ideas and teachings. For many years, his teachings were passed down from person to person. During this time the Buddha was seen as a teacher, not as a god or ruler.
<p>
About three hundred years after the Buddha died, structures were built to honour him. Although the monuments were built to honour the Buddha, he was never shown in the decorations as a man. Instead, symbols are used to represent the Buddha himself, different events in his life and his teachings. 
</p>
<p>
You are writing a book about the life of the Buddha. In order to write this book you will have to choose some objects to illustrate the story of the Buddha's life and development of his beliefs.
