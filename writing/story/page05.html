Isvara Deva thought that Panini's ideas were wonderful and offered to help him with his task. 
</p>
They sat together for many hours and Isvara taught Panini what he knew. Then they discussed how the rules could be changed. Finally, Panini spoke about his ideas and what he had learned from their discussions. 
<p>
Panini learned all he could from Isvara. Then he said goodbye to his teacher and began his work.
