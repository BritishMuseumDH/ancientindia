obj1_t=Terracotta pot sherd: Unglazed terracotta sherd. Black and white paint but no decoration.&obj2_t=Metal coin with animal and marks which may be writing or decoration on the front. Tree and symbols on back of coin. Probably made of copper or bronze.&obj3_t=Terracotta pot: Unglazed, unpainted pot found with charred grain inside.&obj4_t=Fragment of stone: Small fragment of stone with writing or decoration across the curved front.&expert1obj1=I cannot perform tests on pottery.&expert1obj2=I do not perform tests on metal.&expert1obj3=I cannot perform tests on pottery. However, I did a test a sample of the grain found inside the pot which was removed when it was first found. I would give the grain a date of about 2000 B.C.&expert1obj4=I do not perform tests on stone.&expert2obj1=I was able to test this pot sherd. From the results of the test I would give it a date of about 2800 B.C. However, I am not sure if the results are accurate since the sherd was exposed to some light and heat after it was dug up.&expert2obj2=Thermoluminescence does not work on metal.&expert2obj3=I can't test this pot because it sat in the sun for many hours after it was found. The test I use is quite sensitive and materials being tested must be kept away from light and heat from the moment they are found. Otherwise, the test is not accurate.&expert2obj4=I was able to test the stone which this writing is on. It dates from about 200 B.C.&expert3obj1=There is no writing or decoration on this pot sherd.&expert3obj2=I can only read part of the inscription written in Brahmi script which says,'Ra...nisa'. It probably once read 'Rano Shri Satakanisa' which would mean it was issued by the Satavahana king Satakarni who ruled in the first century B.C.&expert3obj3=There is no writing on this pot.&expert3obj4=How exciting! This is a fragment from one of the emperor Ashoka's pillar edicts. Ashoka set up over 30 pillars around his empire from about 243 B.C. to mark his territory and remind his people of the importance of the Buddhist way of life. This text is written in the Prakrit language using the Brahmi script.&expert4obj1=This type of pot sherd is probably from a very early pot. It is from the Kot Diji period, so I would give it a date of about 2800 B.C.&expert4obj2=This is a bronze coin which is probably from the period between the first century B.C. and the second century A.D. because it shows the elephant design which is typical of coins from this period. It also has the cross-like symbol for the Satavahana capital of Ujjain on the back.&expert4obj3=This pot was found at a site where most of the objects come from before 1800 B.C. It is a great example of a type of pot made in the Indus Valley in about 2000 B.C. The grain inside the pot is a type grown in India before 1000 B.C.&expert4obj4=This is one of the Ashoka pillars from the third century B.C. There were once over 30 pillars, but only 10 pillars still exist today. The pillars originally stood about 40-50 feet high and weighed up to around 50 tons each.
