On the front of the coin is an elephant surrounded by a pool with fish in it. This design was often used on early Indian coins. Also on the front of the coin is an inscription in Brahmi script. It reads, &quot;Ra...nisa&quot;. Although this inscription is not complete, other coins like this have been found with the inscription &quot;Rano Shri Satakanisa&quot;. This means that the coin was probably issued by an early ruler of the Satavahana dynasty called Satakarni.

<p>
On the back of the coin is a sacred tree as well as a cross-like symbol representing the capital of the Satavahanas, called Ujjain.
