Archaeologists use many different methods for working out when objects were made. They sometimes work it out by comparing the unknown object with another object of known date. However, they often need to consult with specialists such as scientists, <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/epigrapher.html','epig')">epigraphers</a>, historians and other archaeologists.
<p>
You are a young archaeologist-in-training. You have been given a box of artefacts to sort. The objects were found at different ancient Indian sites. The archaeologist you are working with has asked you to put the contents of the box in a roughly <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/chronological.html','chro')">chronological</a> order. You may ask several specialists for help in completing this task. Remember that most of the dates you are given for the objects will not be exact or precise.
