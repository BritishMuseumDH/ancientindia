<h3>Excavation of Indus Valley sites continues</h3>

<a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/excavation.html','exca')">Excavations</a> stopped at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in the late 1930s. <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/archaeologist.html','arch')">Archaeologists</a> studied the objects found and the buildings and layout of the city. 

<p>Excavations began again at Mohenjo-daro in the 1950s. Archaeologists excavated new parts of Mohenjo-daro, but also looked again at parts of the site which had been excavated earlier. In the years which had passed since the first excavations, there had been many changes in the techniques of recording information and general archaeological practices.  
</p>
In recent years, scholars and archaeologists have looked again at early excavations and have revisited the sites to dig in different areas. The application of new scientific techniques to some of the material has also meant that archaeologists have learned many new things about how people lived in these cities.  


<p>Other important Indus Valley sites were also discovered and excavated in the twentieth century. Some of these sites are listed below.</p>  

<strong>Amri</strong><br> Amri was an important settlement located near the Indus River. Early excavations at Amri revealed evidence of settlements which were dated to a period before what is known as the Indus Valley Civilization period.  </p>

<strong>Banawali</strong> <br>Banawali was an important Indus Valley city located near the dry Sarasvati River. It was excavated at the beginning of the twentieth century.   

<p><strong>Kalibangan</strong> <br>
Kalibangan was an early Indus Valley city located next to the Ghaggar River which is now dry. It was first excavated in 1959. Kalibangan was probably one of the larger Indus Valley cities. It had a similar town plan to that of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa with a raised 'citadel' area and streets organised on a grid plan. </p>

<strong>Kot Diji</strong> <br>Kot Diji was an early Indus Valley settlement located near the Indus River. It was first excavated in the 1950s.  

<p><strong>Lothal</strong> <br>Lothal was an Indus Valley city located on the Gulf of Cambay. It was first excavated in 1954. Archaeologists believe that Lothal was probably a trading post.</p>

<p>Archaeologists have found a large brick basin along one of the settlement walls. The basin is 219 metres long, 37 metres wide and 4.5 metres deep. Some believe that the basin was a dockyard, others think it may have been a type of reservoir used to hold fresh water.</p>

<p><strong>Mehrgarh</strong><br> Mehrgarh was a very early settlement located near the Bolan Pass on the Bolan River. It was found and first excavated in the 1970s. </p>

<strong>Mundigak</strong><br> Mundigak was an important early settlement located in modern Afghanistan. Archaeologists believe that Mundigak was located on an ancient trade route.  

<p><strong>Rana Gundai</strong> <br>Rana Gundai was an Indus Valley settlement located in a mountainous region west of the Indus River. It was first explored in the 1920s.</p>
