<h3>Mauryan Empire founded</h3>

In the fourth century B.C. Chandragupta Maurya took over the lands in northern India controlled by the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/n/nandas.html','nand')">Nandas</a>. He then expanded his kingdom to north-western India and gained control over the lands which had been part of the Persian Empire and briefly controlled by Alexander the Great. Thus, Chandragupta Maurya united most of northern India and founded the Mauryan Empire. 

<p>Perhaps the most famous of the Mauryans was Chandragupta Maurya's grandson named Ashoka who came to power in the third century B.C.</p>

The Mauryan Empire lasted until about 185 B.C. when it collapsed. The land which had been controlled by the empire broke up into several separate states.
