<h3>Early visitors to Harappa</h3>

In the early nineteenth century, many western travellers journeyed to India. While there, they visited sites which were well known by local people, but not widely known about in the west.   

<p>Several of these early travellers left behind accounts of where they visited and what they saw. At this time, the Indus Valley Civilization was unknown. </p> 

In 1826, a man named Charles Masson visited the site of Harappa and wrote a record of what he saw there. He was followed in 1831 by Alexander Burns who was mapping the course of the Indus River.  

<p>Between 1850 and 1860, <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/cunningham.html','cunn')">Alexander Cunningham </a>visited Harappa a couple of times. On these visits he explored the area around the citadel mound and found ancient stairs on two sides of the mound.
