<h3>Attempts to decipher Indus script</h3>

From the moment that the first Indus Valley seal was found, people have been trying to work out the meaning of the signs. However, the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/scripts.html','scri')">script</a> has not yet been <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/deciphered.html','deci')">deciphered</a>.

<p>There are two main problems which make <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/decipherment.html','deci')">decipherment</a> difficult. The first problem is that most Indus <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/i/inscription.html','insc')">inscriptions</a> are only a few signs long and probably represent names or titles. It is almost impossible to decipher a script with such short samples of writing.</p>

The second problem with deciphering the script is that we do not know for sure what language was used in the Indus Valley. If the language was known, scholars might be able to try assigning sound or word values to the signs.

<p>Although the script remains <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/u/undeciphered.html','unde')">undeciphered</a>, in the past 100 years scholars have made great progress in learning about the signs themselves by using established methods of decipherment, computers and information from excavations at Indus Valley sites.</p>

As new inscriptions are found, they add to our understanding of the signs. However, in order to actually decipher the script, archaeologists would need to find a very long inscription or a <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/b/bilingual.html','bili')">bilingual</a> text.
