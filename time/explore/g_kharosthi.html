<h3>Brahmi and Kharosthi script in use</h3>


The first evidence for the use of Brahmi <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/scripts.html','scri')">script</a> in India comes from around 250 B.C. It was used to write several different languages, including <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/sanskrit.html','sans')">Sanskrit</a> and <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/prakrit.html','prak')">Prakrit</a>. Over 200 modern Indian scripts are based on Brahmi script.

<p>Brahmi script is written from left to right and was used to write on a variety of materials such as stone, terracotta and metal.</p>

Kharosthi was a script used in the north-western region of India between about the fifth century B.C. and the third century A.D. It was used to write many different local languages like Prakrit. 

<p>Kharosthi was based on the Aramaic script used by the  <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/achaemenid.html','acha')">Achaemenid Empire</a> which controlled north-western India around the fifth century B.C.
</p>
Kharosthi is written from right to left. Examples of Kharosthi script have been found on stone, metal, leather and parchment. Many of these objects were Buddhist records which describe donations and the foundation of buildings. However, Kharosthi script was used in <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/l/literary.html','lite')">literary</a>  as well as <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/administrative.html','admi')">administrative</a> documents.
