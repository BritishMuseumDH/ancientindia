<h3>Mohenjo-daro abandoned</h3>
			
			
Archaeologists believe that by 1700 B.C. the large city of Mohenjo-daro had been <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/abandoned.html','aban')">abandoned</a>.

<p>Scholars have many different opinions about why people may have abandoned the Indus Valley cities. Some believe that it may have been because the natural resources such as wood and animal populations became scarce, forcing people to seek other places to settle.</p>

Some scholars used to think that the Indus Valley cities had been attacked by an invading army, causing them to abandon their cities. However no evidence has been found to support the theory, so experts today believe that this theory is probably not true.
