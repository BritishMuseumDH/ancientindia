<h3>Development of Kharosthi script</h3>

Kharosthi was a <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/scripts.html','scri')">script</a> used in the northwestern region of India between about the fifth century B.C. and the third century A.D. It was used to write many different local languages. 

<p>Kharosthi was based on the Aramaic script used by the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/achaemenid.html','acha')">Achaemenid Empire</a> which controlled northwestern India around the fifth century B.C.</p>

Kharosthi is written right to left. Examples of Kharosthi script have been found on stone, metal, leather and parchment. Many of these objects were Buddhist records which describe donations and the foundation of buildings. However, Kharosthi script was used in literary as well as <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/administrative.html','admi')">administrative</a> documents.
