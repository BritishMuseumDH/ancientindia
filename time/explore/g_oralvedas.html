<h3>Oral Composition of the Vedas</h3>

The Vedas are the most important religious texts of the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/v/vedic.html','vedi')">Vedic</a> people. It is believed that the Vedas were originally composed as a result of divine inspiration and passed down <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/o/orally.html','oral')">orally</a> from generation to generation.

<p>The Vedas are made up of four books of <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/h/hymn.html','hymn')">hymns</a>. The first and most important is called the Rigveda which was probably composed between 1500 B.C. and 1200 B.C. The second book is called the Samaveda. The third book is called the Yajuraveda. The fourth book is called the Atharvaveda. The last three books were probably composed between 1000 and 500 B.C.
