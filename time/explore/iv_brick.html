<h3>Brick-robbing at Harappa</h3>

By the mid-nineteenth century, local people had used bricks from the ancient site of Harappa to build the nearby modern village of the same name.    
<p>In the 1870s, a railroad was being built from Lahore to Multan. The engineers in charge of laying the track heard about the sturdy bricks from Harappa. Since they needed <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/b/ballast.html','ball')">ballast </a>to anchor the tracks, they investigated the site. For several years, they carted the ancient bricks away in huge numbers. This left the ancient site largely reduced in size.   </p>
