<h3>Excavations begin at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro</h3>

In 1920, Rai Badadur Daya Ram Sahni began excavating at Harappa. In 1921, Rakal Das Banerji began <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/excavating.html','exca')">excavating </a>at Mohenjo-daro. When the objects found during these excavations were compared, it became clear that they came from a common culture.

<p>These excavations continued throughout the 1920s and 1930s. During this time, archaeologists uncovered streets and houses of the cities and found many different types of objects. From this evidence, they were able to begin to piece together ideas about the people who had lived in these cities thousands of years ago.
