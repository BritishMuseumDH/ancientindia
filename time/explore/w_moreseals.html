<h3>More Indus seals found</h3>

<p>
After the first seal was found at Harappa in 1872, people became very interested in the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/sites.html','site')">site</a>. In the next few years many more seals were found at Harappa. These seals were similar in style to the first seal found.
