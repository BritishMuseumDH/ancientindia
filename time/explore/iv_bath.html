<h3>Great Bath is constructed at Mohenjo-daro</h3>

<p>One of the most famous and recognisable structures from the Indus Valley is the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro. It was constructed of baked brick and lined with <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/b/bitumen.html','bitu')">bitumen</a>, which would have made it watertight in antiquity.  
</p><div align="center"><img src="images/great_bath_large.jpg" width="340" height="222" border="0" alt=""></div><p>The Great Bath measures 12 metres long and 7 metres wide. At its deepest point it is 2.4 metres deep. Archaeologists believe that it was probably used for <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/ritual.html','ritu')">ritual</a> bathing or religious ceremonies. However, no one knows for sure why it was built or how it was used.
