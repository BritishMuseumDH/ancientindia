<h3>Decline of Indus Civilization</h3>
			
In about 1900 B.C. the cities of the Indus Valley seem to have gone into <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/decline.html','decl')">decline</a>.
<p>Archaeologists have found evidence showing that building construction changed at this point. In addition, the crafts produced at this period were not as well made as they had been in earlier times.</p>

<p>Scholars have many different opinions about why the civilization went into decline. Some believe that it may have been because the natural resources such as wood and animal populations became scarce, forcing people to seek other places to settle.</p>

Another theory is that the Indus Valley cities were attacked and destroyed by Aryan invaders from the north. This theory is unlikely to be true since there is no evidence of widespread destruction or killing from this period at any Indus Valley site.
