<h3>Early settlements develop in Indus Valley</h3>

From about 6500 B.C., early settlements formed in the Indus Valley. Settlements like Mehrgarh began as village farming communities and pastoral camps. Crop cultivation and <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/domestication.html','dome')">domestication</a> of animals was undertaken in these communities.

<p>In about 5000 B.C., small communities were establishing trade networks which connected them with communities further away. At this time, new technologies were developed, such as copper working.</p>

By 3500 B.C. walled settlements were built. This period is thought to represent the earliest phase of the Indus Valley Civilization. Some important sites at this time were Kalibangan, Amri, Dholavira and Kot Diji
