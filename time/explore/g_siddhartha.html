<h3>Birth of Siddhartha Gautama</h3>

<p>In about 563 B.C. a prince was born in a kingdom in eastern Nepal. He lived a life of <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/privilege.html','priv')">privilege</a> and wealth until he was a young adult. After he came into contact with the pain and suffering of the world he gave up his life of luxury. </p>

<p>After trying many forms of religious activity, he still had not found peace and understanding of life. He decided that he would search for answers within himself through <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/meditation.html','medi')">meditation</a>. </p>

After meditating for many days, he reached <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/enlightenment.html','enli')">Enlightenment</a>. After this, he was known as the Buddha. He devoted the rest of his life to teaching others.
