<h3>Lothal</h3>

<p>Lothal was an Indus Valley city located on the Gulf of Cambay. It was first excavated in 1954. Archaeologists believe that Lothal was probably a trading post.</p> 

Archaeologists have found a large brick basin along one of the settlement walls. The basin is 219 metres long, 37 metres wide and 4.5 metres deep. Some believe that the basin was a dockyard, others think it may have been a type of reservoir used to hold fresh water.
