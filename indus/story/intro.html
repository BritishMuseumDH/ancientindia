When archaeologists <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/excavate.html','excav')">excavate</a> ancient cities, they find the remains of houses, streets and large buildings as well as objects made and used by people long ago. However, there is still much we do not know about what ancient people thought about, what their concerns, hopes and dreams were, and how they actually lived in their cities. 
<p>
We can sometimes learn about the thoughts and ideas of ancient people through their letters, documents and literature. However, we still cannot read the words of the people who lived in <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/i/indus_valley.html','ival')">Indus Valley</a> cities so long ago.

This is a <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/f/fictional.html','fict')">fictional</a> story about a boy living in about 2100 B.C. It was written based on the artefacts and remains found at an Indus Valley <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/sites.html','site')">site</a>.
