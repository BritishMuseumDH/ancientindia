When the boy's father had finished sorting the beads, he and the boy left the house to go to the marketplace. They stepped out of their doorway into an alley. Then they walked to the main road and turned towards the upper town.
<p>
The main road was wide and busy with people and animals. This road ran straight across the lower town. The boy and his father passed by two or three other main roads which cut across the lower town. Along the sides of these roads ran the drains which carried waste water out of town.
