<p>
Evidence of trading links between communities in the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia exists from as early as about 2600 B.C.
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/k90081_seal.gif" width="250" height="241" alt="Seal from Mesopotamia" border="0"></div>
<p>
This seal was found in the Mesopotamian city of Babylon. The seal shows a bull and has a short <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/i/inscription.html','insc')">inscription</a> in the Indus Valley script.
</p>
<p>
However, it is not square like seals from the Indus Valley. It is round with a knob on the back, which is more like seals from the Gulf island of <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/b/bahrein.html','bahr')">Bahrein</a> which date from about 2000 B.C.
</p>
<p>
Experts believe that this seal may have been used by a merchant from the Indus Valley who was living in Bahrein or Babylon. Other seals like this were found in the <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/sumerian.html','sume')">Sumerian</a> city of Ur.
</p>
<p>
A copy of a square, Indus-type seal with a picture of a bull was also found at Ur. However, this seal had an inscription in <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/cuneiform.html','cune')">cuneiform</a> script rather than in the Indus Valley script.
