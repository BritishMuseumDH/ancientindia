<p>
Although we do not really know exactly how markets in Indus Valley cities would have worked, archaeologists have found large areas which they believe would have been market-places. Food, grain and luxury goods such as <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/carnelian.html','carn')">carnelian</a> may have been traded in areas like this.
</p>
<p>
These open 'market' areas are centrally located and are large enough to hold many people. Sometimes they can only be reached by passing through a large gate. Gates like this would make it possible for <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/o/official.html','offi')">officials</a> to control trade in and out of the city and perhaps even to charge taxes on certain types of goods.
