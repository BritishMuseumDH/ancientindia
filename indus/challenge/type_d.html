<p>
This is an unusual pot. Although pots of this shape are found at Indus Valley sites, they are not common. It is unclear what a pot like this might have been used for. However, a long base like this suggests that this pot would have either been placed in a stand or pushed into the ground as it does not stand up on its own base. This type of pot was probably made on a potter's wheel using fine clay.

<p>
Some of the red paint which was originally used to decorate the pot can still be seen on the pot. However, the pot was probably never decorated with a design as no black paint can be seen on the surface.
