<p>
This is a long-necked type pot which is sometimes found at Indus Valley sites. It has a narrow long neck with a slight bulge at the base of the body with a definite base.  It is not clear how a pot like this may have been used, except that the shape suggests it would probably have held liquid.
</p>
<p>
This pot was probably hand-made, rather than on a potter's wheel, as its shape is irregular. Even after most pots were made using a potter's wheel, some were still made by other methods which were cheaper and faster.
</p>
Some of the red paint which was originally used to decorate the pot is still visible. Although the paint is still visible, the pot was probably never painted with a particular design as no black decoration can be seen on the surface.
